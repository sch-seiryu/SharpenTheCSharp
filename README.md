# SharpenTheCSharp
An exercise project to study C#, .NET Core, NuGet, and WPF(or Avalonia), building an application program targeting Windows NT

## Environment:
* OS: Windows 10 (Windows NT), 64-bit
* Runtime(.NET): .NET SDK 7, .NET Core (not .NET Framework, exactly)
* IDE: VS Code with C# extensions, JetBrains Rider (no Visual Studio); Rider will be major IDE for the project.(due to lack of the cooperative GUI desigining function provided by VS Code and its extensions)
* GUI: WPF (*Avalonia* is also an available option)
  * at this moment, *Avalonia* is chosen and highly considered for UI/GUI programming.
* Dependencies: Out of scope at this moment -> (working in progress)
  * [GUI] *Avalonia* (IDE plugin)
  * [GUI] *ScottPlot.Avalonia* (NuGet)
